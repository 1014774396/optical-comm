	abstract = {In this paper, we model and analyze the end-to-end energy consumption of 100-Gbps coherent long-haul transmis- sion systems. In particular, we investigate the impact of forward error correction (FEC) on the end-to-end energy consumption. We compare the energy efficiency of commonly used modula- tion formats in 100-Gbps transmission, namely dual polarization- quadrature phase-shift-keying (DP-QPSK) and dual polarization- 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-16-QAM), for different transmission distance and input bit error rate. Our energy model includes consumption of transmitter, booster, link amplifier as well as receiver. Compared with previous digital signal processing mod- els, we provide a very detailed model that not only includes all the significant functional blocks (such as timing and carrier recov- ery, chromatic and polarization mode dispersion compensation, and FEC), but also takes into account impact of the number of samples processed every clock cycle and of operations other than multiplications. We have found that receiver energy consumption dominates in transmission systems that use electronic dispersion compensation over long transmission distances. Our results show that for short transmission distances where hard-decision decod- ing is adequate for both modulation formats, DP-16-QAM is more energy efficient than DP-QPSK. However, as the transmission dis- tance increases, the energy saving due to the low symbol rate of DP-16-QAM is offset by the energy consumption of soft-decision decoding. In this case, the two modulation formats have approxi- mately similar energy consumption.},

@article{Prabhu1976,
	abstract = {{\{}{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}p{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}Methods{\}} are given to determine the performance loss caused by imperfect or noisy phase recovery and its use in coherent detection of a {\{}PSK{\}} signal. Numerical results for both binary and quaternary systems are presented so that these results combined with the characteristics of the phase recovery circuit will enable the "best" practical design of a {\{}PSK{\}} receiver. lt is assumed that the phase noise associated with the recovered carrier can have a nonzero mean and a Gaussian or a truncated Gaussian-type distribution. The static error of the phase noise is mostly due to offset frequency tracking of the phaselocked loop used to recover the carrier, but may also include an equivalent phase error produced by the comparator dead zone. The random component of the phase noise is due to thermal noise present in the recovery circuit and is also due to the random modulation that may be present on the carrier. Two plausible probability density functions are assumed for the random component of the phase noise to study the sensitivity of the detection results to the detailed characteristics of the phase noise. For small values of static error and phase noise variance and for moderate values of signal-to-noise ratio, it is shown that the two models of the probability distribution give essentially the same results. Since the exact method of determining the performance is rather complex, we also present some simple upper bounds.{\{}$\backslash$textless{\}}/p{\{}$\backslash$textgreater{\}}},
