#  Description of codes developed by Jose Krause Perin during graduate school at Stanford University
> A brief description of the functions, scripts, and classes used in this project. More detailed comments can be found in each file.

This project contains codes for analysis and simulations of optical communications systems for data center applications. They were used for the generation of most of the results in the following publications:
