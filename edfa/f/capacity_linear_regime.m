function [num, approx] = capacity_linear_regime(E, Pump, Signal, spanAttdB, Namp, df)
%% Compute system capacity in linear regime for a particular EDF length and power loading
% Inputs:
% - E: instance of class EDF
% - Pump: instance of class Channels corresponding to pump
% - Signal: instance of class Channels corresponding to signals
% - spanAttdB: span attenuation in dB
% - Namp: number of amplifiers in the chain
% - df: frequency spacing used for computing ASE power
% Output:
% - num: struct containing the spectral efficiency, gain in dB, ASE power
% in W, and SNR in dB calculated using the numerical method
% - approx: struct similar to num, but calculated using semi-analytical
% methods

% Set channels with zero power with small power for gain/noise calculation
